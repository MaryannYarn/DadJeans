_**Game Description**_

*A Day in the Dog Park* is a standard RPG visualized through Processing. Your character is a dog who is taking a stroll around the neighborhood dog park with your dog walker. Your walker leaves the dogs unattended for a second, and suddenly accidentally sets all the dogs loose! Soon, the dogs' owners are waiting at the local pet shelter, worried sick and hoping their lost pets will eventually be found and brought in safely. You must go on a quest to collect and retrieve your fellow dogs to the shelter, on the way defeating numerous enemies. 
As you fight the enemies, you are given various different moves that you can use on them (bite, charm, bark, pounce). Each time you defeat an enemy, you will have found a lost dog that you can then add to your team. In future battles, you may use any of the dogs from your team. After being able to view your enemies' stats, you are given the option of whether to use the most agile, most loud, most powerful, and most cute dog to use next. Certain attacks would cause more damage to certain enemies. 
When you have defeated every enemy, you have retrieved all the lost dogs and have won the game!
If the dog you have chosen to choose was to get defeated, then
